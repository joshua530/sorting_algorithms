# Sorting Algorithms

This repo contains implementations of the following algorithms:
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- quick sort
- selection sort

## Folders
- main - contains files that ensure the programs generally work as expected
- tests - contains tests for the programs
- root - contains main c files


## Usage
Test Compilation: `gcc tests/tests.h tests/utils.c tests/<test_file> *.c sort.h -o <output_file>`

Program Compilation: `gcc main/<main file> <matching_file_in_root_dir> -o <output_file>`
